# Weather Search

A JavaScript web app using the <a href="https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/">Weather Underground API</a>. The user is able to search current conditions <i>and</i> a forecast for tomorrow. <a href="https://github.com/axios/axios">Axios</a> was used to handle all API calls.

In order to run this app, you'll need an API key from Weather Underground. Clone this repo and then go to `js/main.js`, look for the variable `apiKey` and paste your key. It looks like this: `const apiKey = API KEY GOES HERE`.  Run any kind of server to access the app.
